There's no sense in warning you
But I know where you're headed right now
I've known someone just like her
And it didn't end pretty for me

But nobody could have got in my way
No one could stop me
From throwing my life away
And I know one thing
about the way that you're feeling right now
I know how to take the pain
and tell myself it's ecstasy

Do you love the drama?

I'll just ask you one thing
When it's all over
Come and tell me how you feel
Maybe it'll be different for you
Just come and tell me how you feel
