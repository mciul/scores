Impossible - well, that's a big word
What do you say, let's give it a try

I've heard people don't change
Maybe not, but I think I'll reach for the sky

It's not impossible you're in disguise
It's not impossible that you have traveled in time
It could be true to say you've had adventures
somewhere in a previous life

But it's impossible to express
