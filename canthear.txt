Did you say I was tired
Did you say I was hungry
Did you say I don't look so good
Did you say I was lonely?

Did you say I was stupid
Did you say I was lazy
Did you say I was boring
Did you say I was fighting

Well I can't hear you

Did you say I'm not listening
Did you say I don't love you
Did you say I don't care?

Did you say I don't get it
Did you say I'm not
paying attention?

I can't hear you

It's too loud

I can't hear you

Did you say you were joking?  / smoking
Did you say I'm too sensitive?
Did you say I should just ignore it?

Johnny one-note
Non sequitur

You can yell all you want
I can't hear that

I can't hear you
When you're shouting

I can't hear you
It hurts my ears
I can't hear you
It hurts too much

I wish you could hear me

I hear it ringing
My ears are ringing
Everything's ringing
The rest is silence

Did you say you were hurting? / flirting
Did you say you were lonely? / bony
Did you say no-one listens?
Did you say you were nowhere?

I can't hear you
I wish I could hear you
I can't hear you
Do you think you could hear me?

Did you say I was suited?
Did you say I was hazy?
Did you say I was whoring?
