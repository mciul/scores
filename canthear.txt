Did you say I was tired
Did you say I was hungry
Did you say I don't look so good
Did you say I was lonely?

Did you say I was stupid
Did you say I was lazy
Did you say I was boring
Did you say I was fighting

Well I can't hear you

Did you say I'm not listening
Did you say I don't love you
Did you say I don't care?

Did you say I don't get it
Did you say I'm not
paying attention?

I can't hear you

It's too loud

I can't hear you

Johnny one-note
Non sequitur
